/*  Super Metroid... but with Metroid Prime 3 controls!
    BUT WITH Joystick instead of Nunchuk
    By Carl Kenner

    Your SNES Emulator must use the default ZSNES config, which is:
      DPAD = arrow keys, Start = Enter, Select = Right Shift
      A = X, B = Z, x = S, y = A, L = D, R = C

    Controls are the same as either version of Metroid Prime 3:
      Nunchuk joystick = walk / run
      Nunchuk Z / Wiimote B = Jump (depends on version) or menu select
      Wiimote A = fire
      Wiimote aim up and down = aim up and down
        (aiming straight down only works when jumping)
      Nunchuk C = Morph Ball toggle
      Wiimote D-Pad Down = Fire Missile (or Super Bomb in MorphBall)
      Charge A then Wiimote D-Pad Down = Super Missile
      Wiimote D-Pad Left/Right = X-Ray Visor
      Wiimote D-Pad Up = X-Ray Visor or return to Combat Visor
      Cast Nunchuk Forwards = Grapple Beam
      Pull Nunchuk back = stop Grapple Beam
    And these extra ones
      Home = Toggle map / equipment editor
      + (in Map) = equipment editor
      - (in equipment editor) = map
      1 = Run / activate Visor (not needed, use joystick and dpad)
      2 = Select weapon (not needed unless you have the wrong items)

    Note: Be careful to only change to and from morph-ball by using C
    otherwise it will try to use super-bombs or missiles at the wrong
    times. If you end up with incorrect behaviour, try pressing the C
    button a couple of times.

    You MUST have at least one of each item to use subsequent items!
    Otherwise the automatic item selection and use won't work.
    Collect the items in the correct order, and always keep one spare.
    Trying to use items you don't have, like Grapple or X-Ray visor,
    will cause unknown side-effects. Don't use things you haven't got
    yet. If you do end up with incorrect item selection, you can select
    items manually usings the 2 button. If you select the visor this
    way, hold down 1 to use it.
